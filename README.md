# ECG-Data-Recognition-model
A Machine learning project done for Inter IIT Tech Meet 2023
Problem Statement: https://interiit-tech.org/images/ps/Mid_CloudPhy.pdf

Creating the model for cropping icu monitor out of given image
Monitor Segmentation Dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qCcqEEeTXO9t7dAmG09_IpXXS3S_1tfP
Note: Above dataset was used to train the effnet model with code ( https://github.com/ramsundar-tanikella/ECG-Data-Recognition-model/blob/main/notebook28792b501b.ipynb )
Created effnet model: https://github.com/ramsundar-tanikella/eff_net

Using PaddleOCR, Geometric logics and our effnet model to detect vital values
